# MP3-Player; As of now this is the program's name. Once I finalize on a name for the software, necessary changes will be made.

There are 2 main files for the program, main.py and ui_alt.py

The "main.py" is the primary file I am working on.

The "ui_alt.py" was created to test different styles and themes for the program, as it is a bit time consuming to make changes, each time I wished to try different designs for the UI.

Contributions/Suggestions/Criticisms are all the most welcome.
